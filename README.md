## Code description

* `rnn_ppg.py` pure Python code exported from Colab notebook; used as an imported module by the following scripts when running tests on local computer
* `batch_test.py` script performing series of tests with different parameters
* `parse_log.py` parse log files generated by tests, to compute mean and max values
* `batch_cross_6_1.py`, `batch_cross_6_1_test_only.py` perform leave-one-out cross-training tests
* `PPG_ACC_dataset` dataset directory; you must download the dataset and extract it in your working directory, see links in the article
